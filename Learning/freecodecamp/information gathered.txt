twilio is the collection of api for different thigns 
like messaging , the verififcaiton code, the traffic, the tempreture and som much more 
it is basicallly the business of the api's you use in the website to make the 
website make full of the resources
the great industy of apis 
it even sent the msg  to my phone , however not to another phone as 
the charge is also the matter
and i checked the messaging api in nepal and i found some of the apislike 
akash bulk messaging api 
and sparrow messaging api its like more then 1 ruppes  to one message at a time 
but in a bulk as teahcer said of CG , the cost is vastly different 
also, one thint to conside for the api for messaging thing 
the connection of message to the message app thorugh unlimited plan can be a alternative 
though it takes time to build that , we can learn from videos how to create that

and now i am in the postman app which is platform for development of api


postman  =  generate code
HTTP request are needed to interact with rest api
biolerplate code: repetative code with less tool and more code
helperliberary code is made to overcome that problem 
more precise and legitable

checking helperliberary { understanding in my mind::::

basically, helperliberary vaneko connecting the operation 
required in the form or the way we need the api , is available in differne t language
and
they are powerful
creating , updating , deleting, reading  
through different language available according to the need
ani, that's it 
tesko lagi hamile api id , api token use gareu 
api dokan ko module use gareu 
basicallly, modules contains the keyword which are made without overriding the node or any other codes , rules 
like without violating their keyword 
if available, they prefer original code for their modules
however, the modules are needed to connect as 
encryption or decryption happens,
as that api business itself is selling their api , like messaging verification 
in different paying sectors
so, that's why there is profit for them, but only in bulk size 
}
they abstract the way the http client connection of the REST API boiler plate
they also behave as you expect them to behave
uniform use of the http verbs is pretty powerful


exploring external apis
CLI 
command line interface
used to make API call from an executable from your machine


implementing the external api 
to send the slack message: confession thing or feedback
to send the message before the bus reaches (10 min before)


now embedding in the web application
 

 glich.com 
 to create the existed project

 we are going to use a web framework called flask
 flask provides an API 
 that lets you extend the framework
 to create your application
means , the page will only be created on the server side
 any change require full page reload
